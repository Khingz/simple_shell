  4 .SH SYNOPSIS                                                                    
  5 .B shellby\fR                                                                   
  6 .SH DESCRIPTION                                                                 
  7 .B Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes       
  8 commands read from standard input.                                              
  9 .PP                                                                             
 10 .B Invocation                                                                   
 11 .PP                                                                             
 12 If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with arguments, the first argument is assumed to    
 13 be a string containing arguments.                                               
 14 .B Shellby\fR tokenizes and executes commands from this string, then exits with 
 15 the status of the last command executed.                                        
 16 .PP                                                                             
 17 If \fBshellby\fR is invoked without arguments, an \fIinteractive\fR shell is    
 18 opened.                                                                         
 19 When executing interactively, \fBshellby\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when   
 20 it is ready to read a command.                                                  
 21 .PP                                                                             
 22 .B Command Execution                                                            
 23 .PP                                                                             
 24 After receiving a command, \fBshellby\fR tokenizes it into words and takes the  
 25 following actions:                                                              
 26 .RS                                                                             
 27 If the command name contains no slashes, the shell searches for it in the list  
 28 of shell builtins.                                                              
 29 If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.           
 30 .PP                                                                             
 31 If the command name is not a builtin, \fBshellby\fR searches each element of    
 32 the \fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable  
 33 file by that name.                                                              
 34 .PP                                                                             
 35 If either of the above searches is successful, the shell executes the named     
 36 program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment. 
 37 .RE                                                                             
 38 .PP                                                                             
 39 .B Exit Status                                                                  
 40 .PP                                                                             
 41 .B Shellby\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a    
 42 syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.              
 43 .PP
